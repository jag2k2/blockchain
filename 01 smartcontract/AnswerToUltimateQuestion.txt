I wanted to play around with mathematical operations and the hash256 function.  So basically this output script takes a number and plugs it into the equation 
3x^2 + 2x - 14.  Any result that matches the hash of the number "42" unlocks that output.  

Script Sig:
<0xff122c0ea37f12c5c0f330b2616791df8cb8cc8f1114304afbf0cff5d79cec54>
<4>

ScriptPubKey:
OP_DUP
OP_DUP
OP_MUL
OP_3
OP_MUL
OP_SWAP
OP_2
OP_MUL
OP_ADD
OP_14
OP_SUB
OP_HASH256
OP_EQUAL
